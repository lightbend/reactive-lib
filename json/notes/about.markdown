[spray-json][] is a lightweight, clean and efficient [JSON][] implementation in Scala.

It sports the following features:

* Simple immutable model of the JSON language elements
* An efficient JSON PEG parser (implemented with [parboiled][])
* Choice of either compact or pretty JSON-to-string printing
* Type-class based (de)serialization of custom objects (no reflection, no intrusion)
